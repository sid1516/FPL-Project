# FPL-Project
Full Stack Application simulating an FPL Season using Java, Spring, and React.js

Description: As an avid player of the Fantasy Premier League draft with my friends, I wanted to make my first full-stack project to be related to these topics. This project will allow users to set up their league by entering the league information and team name. The user will also set the number of CPUs that they would like to verse. From there, they can draft their team with a money limit. The CPU teams then draft their players in a snake draft. This project is also partially an experiment to see which version of Fantasy Premier League would result in higher scoring teams. A 38-game FPL season will simulate, and the results will be displayed.
